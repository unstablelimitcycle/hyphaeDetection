# hyphaeDetection

HYPHAEdelity is an application created by Dr. Lisa Rogers and Scott Britton to automate the assessment of two-dimensional whole colony images and quantify the magnitude of peripheral whole colony yeast filamentation. The software application functions by determining the total area of filamentous growth, referred to as the f-measure, utilizing image analysis tools intrinsic to the OpenCV Python library. The data from this analysis is output as a set of binary files and a single statistics-containing csv file.
