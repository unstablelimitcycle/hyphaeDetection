For bulk analysis, use image_reader.py
Input path of folder of images for analysis into folder_to_open = 'your_path_here'.
Set path for written images to be stored to in path = 'your_path_here'. 
Will then output csv with data, written images in folder designated.

For single images, use singleImgGrowthIndex.py
Simply add the name of the image to be analyzed to img = cv2.imread('Your Filename Here')
